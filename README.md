# MyReads Project

This project is an application designed to help you manage your bookshelf.

## Getting Started

To get started on running the app:

* download the files
* open Terminal and `cd` into the project folder
* install all project dependencies with `npm install`
* start the server with `npm start`

### Changing Shelves

Use the green circular icon found on each book to change the shelf that book appears on. This can be done from the main book listing screen or the search screen.

Books set to the "None" shelf disappear into the abyss.

### Search

Click the "+" icon on the bottom right to open the search window. Accepted queries are book titles or authors. When no query is entered, all books will display as sorted alphabetically by title. Unacceptable queries such as special characters will simply display nothing.
